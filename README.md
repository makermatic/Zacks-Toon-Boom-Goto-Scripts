# Zack's Toon Boom Go-To Scripts

## Introduction

These are scripts I made that I use all the time in Toon Boom Harmony. It's fully open source, go nuts! They've made working in Toon Boom way way faster and I hope they can do the same for you!

If I make more of these scripts, I'll definitely add them here for sure!

## What does Each Script Do

1. `quickRename` - Opens a popup that let's you rename as many selected nodes in one place, even drawings.
2. `renameMaster-P` - Same as `quickRename`, except it also adds `master-P` after the name you input (pegs only). 
   - Example: If you input "clown,"  the peg will be renamed to `clown_master-P`.
3. `addXSub` - Adds a drawing sub named `x` to each selected drawing (element).
4. `toggleOpacity` - Toggles the opacity of selected drawings back and forth between 50 and 100.
5. `toggleCompositeMode` - Toggles selected composites between bitmap and passthrough.
6. `toggleStopMoKeys` - When run, it will toggle Stop-Motion Keys on or off in settings. In the Message Log you'll be able to see whether Stop-Mo Keys was turned on or off. 
7. `turnOffAnimTools` - Toggles `Animate with Animation Tools` off on selected drawings, just in case you didn't change the default value in preferences.
8. `setMCtoAlwaysOn` - Toggles "Show Controls Mode" to `Always` on selected Master Controllers.
9. `countFrameSelection` - If you select a range of frames in the timeline and run the script, a pop up will show the number of frames selected and how many seconds it is. 
10. `countnodes` - Displays a pop up that shows the number of nodes selected.
11. `coinFlip` - Self explanatory. When the flip is done, it'll show a pop-up with the result.
