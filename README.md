# Zack's Toon Boom Go-To Scripts

## Introduction

These are scripts I made that I use all the time in Toon Boom Harmony. You're free to download, modify, or even reupload these to anywhere else if you'd like. They've made working in Toon Boom way way faster and I hope they can do the same for you!

If I make more of these scripts, I'll definitely add them here for sure!

## What does Each Script Do

1. `countFrameSelection` - If you select a range of frames in the timeline and run the script, a pop up will show the number of frames selected and how many seconds it is. 
1. `countnodes` - If you selected a range of nodes in the node view and run the script, a pop up will show the number of nodes selected.
2. `coinFlip` - Does exactly what you'd think it would do. When the flip is done, it'll show a pop-up with the result.
3. `toggleStopMoKeys` - When run, it will toggle Stop-Motion Keys on or off in settings. In the Message Log you'll be able to see whether Stop-Mo Keys was turned on or off. 
5. `quickRename` - Opens a popup that let's you rename as many nodes in one place.
